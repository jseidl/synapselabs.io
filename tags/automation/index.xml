      <description>&lt;p&gt;My biggest personal challenge in home automation is a quest to make everyday commoner tasks &amp;ndash; such as turning on and off lights, fans, air conditioners and media devices &amp;ndash; a thing of the past. My ultimate intent is to just do whatever I want to do and for &lt;del&gt;Skynet&lt;/del&gt; the house to figure it out what it is and act accordingly and when I&amp;rsquo;m done I can just walk away and things will turn off themselves. After a few years experimenting with all sorts of stuff, learning how to develop on Home Assistant, I finally came up with a custom component that replaced hundreds of lines of YAML and made me much closer to my goal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
