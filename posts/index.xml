      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main points of a truly smart home is how much it is aware of itself and the things within and around. For I to consider a home to be smart, or even automated, it must do stuff by itself, not because you are giving it commands. If all it does is react to commands, then it&amp;rsquo;s an RC (remote-controlled) home (yes, like toy cars), and that&amp;rsquo;s cool too (but not as cool). I go for an almost sentient state vibe, more like a J.A.R.V.I.S (although Skynet is a risk).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
