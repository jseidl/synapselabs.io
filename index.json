[{"categories":["Home Automation"],"contents":"After slapping around multiple ESPHome-based multisensors around the house, I needed a way to keep them from going off while I\u0026rsquo;m sleeping and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite fond of manually disabling and re-enabling the automations in a daily basis. In order to get Home Assistant to know when myself or my wife are in bed, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to create custom bed occupancy sensors using a pair of bathroom scales, a pair of HX711 load-cell sensors on top of the same framework (ESPHome).\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;re gonna need  ESP32 micro-controller Two HX711 load-cell sensor Some short dupont-cables Optional: 4-conductor (RJ11) telephone cable + dual line RJ11 keystone box  Wiring it up Usually the boards on the bathroom scales have already labeled the S+, S-, E+, E- pads. Just solder those pads to the respective pads on the HX711 and in the other end, connect V, GND, DOUT and CLK to the ESP32. I\u0026rsquo;ve used short cables to wire the bathroom scale side to the HX711 and house the IC inside the bathroom scale cover, drilled a hole to pass the cables through and used a 4-conductor telephone cable and a two-line keystone box to connect the HX711 to the ESP32 (the cable between the keystone box and the ESP32 is a regular ethernet cable because it has all 8 conductors needed).\nBathroom scale board \u0026amp; drilled enclosure.\nFrom left to right: Assembled, HX711 wiring, RJ11 keystone terminals on an ethernet cable, wiring on ESP32 end.\nSetting up the sensor in ESPHome is really easy:\nsensor:\r- platform: hx711\rname: \u0026#34;Bed Weight (L)\u0026#34;\rid: bed_weight_l\rdout_pin: 12\rclk_pin: 14\rWe\u0026rsquo;ll be calibrating and adding filtering to this sensor next.\nCalibrating the HX711 sensors Out of the box the numbers spat out by the HX711 means nothing much. In order to calibrate you start by taking note of the values when there is no-load (or just the expected normal load \u0026ndash; the mattress and bed sheets in this case) and you will need to do the same with at least one known-weight load (thus more is better) on top of your scale and take note of the numbers shown, average them and use in the calibrate_linear filter on ESPHome.\nI had my full clothes hamper at hand so I weighted myself holding it in a regular bathroom scale, then weighted myself alone and subtracted both weights to get the weight of the clothes hamper (5.6kg \u0026ndash; I know, not freedom units), then used it as a known-weight to calibrate my bed sensor. I also used my faithful sliding_window_moving_average filter to iron out erroneous readings and help false-negatives while changing sleep positions at night.\nfilters:\r- calibrate_linear:\r- 66000 -\u0026gt; 0\r- 145000 -\u0026gt; 5.6\r- sliding_window_moving_average:\rwindow_size: 5\rsend_every: 5\rWatch out about WiFi powersave On ESPHome, the default setting for power_save_mode under wifi for ESP32s is LIGHT and that will make your sensor go unavailable from time to time due the ESP32 disconnecting from WiFi in order to save power.

See below a curated list of my bed automations.\n Turn off all lights when bed_full Turn on the alarm at night when bed_full Turn off the alarm in the morning when not bed_full Turn on the lightstrips under the bed when (movement in front of the nightstand) when not bed_occupied (night lights) Disable Alexa voice notifications (input_boolean.voice_notifications) when bed_occupied  That\u0026rsquo;s all for today folks!

That allows us to use only dupont cables and saves us from the hassle (or if you\u0026rsquo;re terrible at soldering like me) of soldering stuff. This is an easy build, inspired by BRUH Automation\u0026rsquo;s $15 Multisensor but using ESPHome instead of custom code.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve spent lots of time building my own library for ESP sensors but when I gave ESPHome a try, I\u0026rsquo;ve immediately trashed all that code and migrated my all sensors into ESPHome. I never looked back and to date I\u0026rsquo;m 100% satisfied with that choice. It allows you to modify and deploy from Home Assistant\u0026rsquo;s ESPHome Add-On, handle unavailable states, have plenty of modules for different components and it\u0026rsquo;s just a breeze to use.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;re gonna need  ESP8266 micro-controller DHT22 temperature \u0026amp; humidity sensor AM312 PIR motion sensor TEMT600 Analog Light Intensity Module 5mm Neopixel LED Some short dupont-cables. Optional: This 3D printed enclosure (requires 3D printer)  Note: I will not cover wiring up with the dupont cables as you can check this out on BRUH Automation\u0026rsquo;s video.\nTemperature \u0026amp; Humidity I left those at 60 seconds intervals, first because it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty acceptable update range for temperature sensing and second because DHT22s aren\u0026rsquo;t quite fond of being probed all the time.
