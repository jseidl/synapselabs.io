[{"categories":null,"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;m a Brazilian information security warlock living in the US obssesed by robots. I always loved electronics and automating everything. I\u0026rsquo;ve wrote IRC bots, chatbots, scraper bots, videogame bots you name it. I got my second job by coding a bot to do my first one. Did I said already I fucking love robots and automation? Hell yea! ðŸ¤Ÿ\nI work at Brave Software making sure our infrastructure stay secure and automating processes so our buddies can focus on the important things. Before that I used to work protecting critical infrastructure from really bad people. So, if you still have your utilities going, you\u0026rsquo;re welcome ðŸ˜‰.\n","permalink":"https://synapselabs.io/about/","tags":null,"title":"About Me"}]
